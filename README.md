# E-commerce-Customer-Behavior-Analysis

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of ecommerce customer behavior leveraging Python for data analysis, SQL for querying and answering data-related questions, and Excel for data manipulation and presentation. A key aspect of the project involved calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for all customers, providing insights into their long-term value to the business. Using various regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression, I predicted CLV values and compared the performance of these models to determine the most accurate predictive approach. Additionally, I explored and visualized patterns and trends in customer behavior using Tableau, offering actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
Implemented Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development, ensuring data accuracy and model reliability.
Utilized SQL queries to extract relevant data from the database and answer business-related questions, enabling informed decision-making.
Developed CLV metrics to quantify the value of individual customers over their lifetime, providing valuable insights into customer segmentation and targeting strategies.
Employed advanced regression techniques including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to predict CLV values with high accuracy, optimizing marketing efforts and resource allocation.
Presented findings and recommendations using Excel, effectively communicating complex analyses in a clear and concise manner.
